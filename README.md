You will need to change the site's persmissions in order to hear the wonderful music on most browsers. To do so you generally need to set 'Audio' to ALLOW instead of either ASK or AUTOMATIC
The settings menu is generally found by clicking the padlock icon to the left of the search bar (for FIREFOX users, there is a dedicated 'Permissions' button right next to the search bar instead.)

Note: this only affects this specific website and has no impact on other website's permissions
